# League game server emulator
Yet another lol server,
created with the help of the [LeagueSandbox](https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer) code,
written in JavaScript ([nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)).  
This project was made as just 4fun and will be not continued or will be very rarely,
anyway making it in JS is not the best idea.  
At the moment, all what you can do is load game client and move your champion.  

# Runing
```
# download and install nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en/download/
git clone https://github.com/Karmel0x/enetcppjs
git clone https://github.com/Karmel0x/LeagueEmulatorJS
cd LeagueEmulatorJS
node main
```
```
# download game client (4.20) here - https://github.com/LeagueSandbox/GameServer#manual-setup-windowsmac
# copy runLol.bat to client directory and run
```
